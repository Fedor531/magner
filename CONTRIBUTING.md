# Contributing

Before creating a Pull Request with your changes to this repository, please discuss
a problem or an enhancement in the Issues page or in GitHub discussions. Maintainers will
reply to you as soon as possible.

## First contribution

If you are new to contribution process, you can take a look at the Issues page for issues with
the label "good first issue" which might be easier than other ones but put into a backlog
because of project priorities.

Or, if there is any bug or something is missing in the library, create a new issue. If you want to implement it
and API is discussed with maintainers, assign yourself to the issue. Then, make changes and open a PR that follows
the instructions below.

## Pull Request process

* If there are some files needed for you but un-needed for the project, ensure you have removed them or added to .gitignore before push
* Do not update or install any dependencies
* Remember to update documentation when you add or remove a feature from library
* It is better to update examples if there is a feature that concerns it
