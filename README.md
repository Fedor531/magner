## Problems and troubleshooting

> What is this feature for? How should I use this property in the config? 

If you ask yourself similar questions while using Magner, please, check the structured documentation links
from above. It explains main concepts and shows the usage of different configurations.

If you need to dive deeper than the documentation, check the TypeScript interfaces: hover over the
property in the config and do "Go to definition" in your IDE: CMD+Click in Webstorm, Ctrl+Click in VS Code.

As a last resort, you can open an issue (or discussion) in the repo or contact [the maintainer](https://t.me/vanishmax) 
with your problem or proposal.
